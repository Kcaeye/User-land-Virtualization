# User-land-Virtualization
Code for handling segmentation fault signals, and possibly others.


End Goal:
  After adding what is neccessary, hopefully the porgram will be able to run linux as a process inside another linux kernel as just a regular process that can map an unauthorized adress for a process without the user explicitly adding this functionality beforehand.
